React Hooks have revolutionized the way we write React components. In this post, we'll explore the basics of React Hooks and how they can simplify your code.

## What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They were introduced in React 16.8 to allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

## The useState Hook

The `useState` hook is one of the most commonly used hooks. It lets you add state to function components. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useState` returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.

## The useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components. It serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes, but unified into a single API.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useEffect` is used to update the document title after React updates the DOM.

React Hooks provide a more direct way to use the features of React. They encourage the use of functions over classes and can lead to more concise and easier-to-understand code.
