# Baking the Perfect Website: A Deep Dive into Pie-Site-Baker

Hey there, fellow web enthusiasts! ðŸ‘‹ Today, we're going to roll up our sleeves and dig into the delicious world of Pie-Site-Baker, our homemade static site generator. If you've ever wanted to create your own website but found other tools too complex or inflexible, you're in for a treat! ðŸ¥§

## The Recipe: Understanding Pie-Site-Baker's Structure

Before we start mixing our ingredients, let's take a look at what's in our kitchen (aka the project structure):

```
pie-site-baker/
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.yaml (our recipe card)
â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resume.json
â”œâ”€â”€ output/ (where our baked goods end up)
â”œâ”€â”€ siteforge/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ processors/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base_processor.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog_processor.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page_processor.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resume_processor.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ generator.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ markdown_extensions.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.py
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog_index.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ landing.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ post.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resume.html
â””â”€â”€ main.py (our oven switch)
```

Think of this structure as your well-organized kitchen. Each folder and file has its place and purpose, just like your mixing bowls, measuring cups, and cooking utensils.

## The Secret Sauce: How Pie-Site-Baker Works Its Magic

### Templating: The Pie Crust

At the heart of Pie-Site-Baker is our templating system, powered by Jinja2. It's like the crust of our pie â€“ it holds everything together and gives our site its structure.

Here's a taste of how it works:

```html
<!-- In base.html (our pie crust) -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{% block title %}{{ config.site_name }}{% endblock %}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <nav><!-- Navigation items --></nav>
    <main>
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    </main>
    <footer><!-- Footer content --></footer>
</body>
</html>

<!-- In post.html (a slice of our pie) -->
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}{{ post.title }} - {{ config.site_name }}{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<article>
    <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
        {{ post.content | safe }}
    </div>
</article>
{% endblock %}
```

Just like how you can fill a pie crust with different fillings, we can fill our `base.html` template with different content for each page. Neat, right?

### Processors: The Filling Makers

Our processors are like the chefs that prepare different fillings for our pie. Each processor (`BlogProcessor`, `PageProcessor`, `ResumeProcessor`) knows how to handle a specific type of content.

For example, the `BlogProcessor` takes your Markdown blog posts and transforms them into tasty HTML:

```python
class BlogProcessor(BaseProcessor):
    def process(self):
        blog_posts = self.get_blog_posts()
        self.generate_blog_index(blog_posts)
        self.generate_blog_posts(blog_posts)
```

### URL Generation: The Serving Directions

Ever wondered how Pie-Site-Baker knows where to place each slice of pie on the serving platter? That's where our URL generation comes in:

```python
def get_url(self, path):
    return '../' * self.current_depth + path.lstrip('/')
```

This clever little function makes sure that no matter where a page is in your site structure, it can always find its way to other pages. It's like having a map of your pie, ensuring you can always find that cherry in the corner!

## Let's Get Baking: Customizing and Expanding Pie-Site-Baker

Now that we understand the basics, let's talk about how you can customize Pie-Site-Baker to make it truly your own. After all, the best pies are the ones that have your personal touch!

### Adding a New Section: More Slices for Your Pie

Let's say you want to add a new "Projects" section to your website. Here's how you'd do it:

1. Create a new processor in `siteforge/processors/project_processor.py`:

```python
from .base_processor import BaseProcessor

class ProjectProcessor(BaseProcessor):
    def process(self):
        projects = self.get_projects()
        self.generate_project_index(projects)
        self.generate_project_pages(projects)

    def get_projects(self):
        # Logic to get project data
        pass

    def generate_project_index(self, projects):
        # Logic to generate project index page
        pass

    def generate_project_pages(self, projects):
        # Logic to generate individual project pages
        pass
```

2. Create a new template in `templates/project.html`:

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
<h1>{{ project.title }}</h1>
<p>{{ project.description }}</p>
<img src="{{ project.image }}" alt="{{ project.title }}">
<!-- Add more project details as needed -->
{% endblock %}
```

3. Update `siteforge/generator.py`:

```python
from siteforge.processors.project_processor import ProjectProcessor

def generate_site(config):
    # ...
    project_processor = ProjectProcessor(config)
    project_processor.process()
    # ...
```

4. Add project content in `content/projects/`.

5. Update `config/config.yaml`:

```yaml
navigation:
  - name: Home
    url: index.html
  - name: Blog
    url: blog/index.html
  - name: Projects
    url: projects/index.html
  - name: Resume
    url: resume.html
```

Voila! You've just added a whole new section to your website. It's like adding a new flavor to your pie menu!

### Styling Your Pie: Making It Look Delicious

Want to give your site a unique look? It's as easy as adjusting the frosting on your pie:

1. Modify `content/assets/css/custom.css`:

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
}

.navbar {
    background-color: #ff6b6b;
}

.blog-post {
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

2. Update `templates/base.html` to include your custom CSS:

```html
<head>
    <!-- ... other head elements ... -->
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ get_url('assets/css/custom.css') }}">
</head>
```

Now your site has a fresh, modern look with rounded corners, subtle shadows, and a punchy color scheme!

### Adding Sprinkles: Implementing New Features

The beauty of Pie-Site-Baker is that you can keep adding features to make your site even more delightful. Here are a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing:

1. **Comment System**: Integrate a comment system like Disqus into your blog posts.
2. **Search Functionality**: Implement a JavaScript-based search for your static site.
3. **Image Gallery**: Create a new processor and template for handling beautiful image galleries.
4. **Tag System**: Add a tagging system for your blog posts and generate tag pages.
5. **RSS Feed**: Generate an RSS feed for your blog to keep your readers updated.

For example, let's add a simple tag system:

1. Update `BlogProcessor` to handle tags:

```python
class BlogProcessor(BaseProcessor):
    def process(self):
        blog_posts = self.get_blog_posts()
        self.generate_blog_index(blog_posts)
        self.generate_blog_posts(blog_posts)
        self.generate_tag_pages(blog_posts)

    def generate_tag_pages(self, blog_posts):
        tags = {}
        for post in blog_posts:
            for tag in post['metadata'].get('tags', []):
                if tag not in tags:
                    tags[tag] = []
                tags[tag].append(post)
        
        for tag, posts in tags.items():
            self.generate_tag_page(tag, posts)

    def generate_tag_page(self, tag, posts):
        # Logic to generate a page for each tag
        pass
```

2. Create a new template `templates/tag.html`:

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
<h1>Posts tagged with "{{ tag }}"</h1>
<ul>
    {% for post in posts %}
    <li><a href="{{ get_url(post.url) }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endblock %}
```

Now you have a tag system that creates pages for each tag used in your blog posts. It's like adding a sprinkle of organization to your content pie!
